#!/usr/bin/env bash
# prune-branches.sh -- delete local branches whose work has landed on main.
#
#   .githooks/post-merge -> runs this after every `git pull` on main
#   bash scripts/prune-branches.sh             # prune now
#   bash scripts/prune-branches.sh --dry-run   # print what it would delete, delete nothing
#
# Merged branches are deleted on both sides, always:
#   - on the server, by the repo setting "Automatically delete head branches"
#     (gh repo edit --delete-branch-on-merge; install-hooks.sh checks it is on);
#   - in every clone, by this script. The server setting never touches a clone, so
#     without it each contributor's `git branch` fills up with finished work, and a
#     stale branch is how someone ends up committing onto work that already merged.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT COUNTS AS MERGED (read this before making the script more eager)
#
#   A branch is deleted only when it is PROVEN merged. Everything else is kept.
#
# Only branches that were pushed (have an upstream) are considered -- a local-only
# branch is someone's unpushed work, and this script never touches it. A pushed branch
# is merged when either:
#   1. its tip is an ancestor of origin/main (merge commit or fast-forward), or
#   2. its upstream is gone and GitHub has a pull request MERGED INTO main whose head is
#      exactly this branch's tip (squash and rebase merges rewrite the commits, so 1
#      can't see them). A branch with commits after the merged PR's head fails this
#      check and is kept -- those commits exist nowhere else. So is one whose PR merged
#      into some other branch: its work isn't on main.
# main/master and the checked-out branch are never deleted.
