"""The shot planner: each scene becomes shots that cover all its elements, in order, and name only
what the script and the grounded extraction put there. docs/design/shots.md §4.

Ported from FrameFlow's shot_service.py: the shot-list call, the camera vocabularies, and the
explicit time of day (a CONTINUOUS heading once got "soft overcast light" in a night scene). Not
ported: the free-text frame description (where invention lived), the hard-coded no-model shots (a
placeholder), and the Redis cache (Redis is gone).
