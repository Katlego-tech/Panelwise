"""What the script and storyboard pages read: web.md §6 views, built from a project's stage results.

Pure: no database, no I/O. T047 loads the stage columns and calls these. Every view keeps the
spans it was given and adds nothing the parse, the grounded extraction or the plan doesn't hold:
dropped entities never appear, and a shot's segments are exactly the lines of its elements.
