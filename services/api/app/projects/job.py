"""The upload's job: run the pipeline and write what it reports (web.md §3, §4.1, §6; T046).

Each stage's column and the job's advance are one transaction, so a page never sees a stage's
result without the job saying it is there, nor the other way round. A failure the user can act
on carries §4.1's copy (`PipelineError`); anything else is a bug: logged with its traceback, and
the job says only "something went wrong on our side". `run_job` never raises (it runs as a
background task); a cancelled one stays RUNNING for the next start's sweep.
