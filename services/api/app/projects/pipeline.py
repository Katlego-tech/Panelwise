"""The pipeline core: PDF bytes -> parsed script -> grounded extraction -> shot plan.

docs/design/web.md §3 (stages, progress bands), §4.1 (failure copy), §6 (the contract). No
database: T046 runs this as a job and writes what `on_advance` reports, one transaction per call,
so a page never sees a stage's column without the job's advance. T026 adds the rendering stage.

Every failure the user can cause, or that a model call can, leaves as a `PipelineError` carrying
the copy the job row shows. The copy is chosen by `ScriptParseError.code`, the exception's type
and its `scene`, never by its message: a message is for the log (it stays on `__cause__`).
