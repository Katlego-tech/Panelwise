"""The re-check: today's code checks run again on what the audit already saw and judged
(docs/design/verify.md §6, T083).

    python -m app.verify.recheck <project-id> [--target storyboard|comic]

It reads each stored audit's description and judgement and runs today's `run_checks` on them:
no model call, no Storage, no write. So a change to the checks alone is measured for free, on
the very audits it changes. A change to what the describer or the judge is asked needs reaudit.
The rule ladder (T094) applies as it does live: `AUDIT_WITHHOLD_CHECKS` names the hard checks
that withhold, so measure a rule's way back by naming it there.
