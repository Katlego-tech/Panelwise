"""The frame prompt: Non-negotiable I on the input to the image model. docs/design/storyboard.md
§3.1.

A pure function of the shot, the screenplay, the extraction and the style. Its script words come
only from this shot's scene heading and the Action elements it covers, each part tagged with the
span it came from, so a test (and a reader) can check every word against the script. It takes no
free text: not the shot's rationale, not a model's description, not a character's introduction
from another shot (it would carry that moment's event into this frame). Dialogue, parentheticals
and camera movement never enter it: speech isn't visible and puts letters in the art, and a still
can't pan. Names are redacted before anything else happens to the text.

Ported from FrameFlow's storyboard_service.py: comma phrases (how CLIP reads captions), the medium
first, the setting as "inside <place>" straight after the framing, the resolved clock, the framing
vocabulary. Not ported: the free-text frame description and its fallback to the scene's first 400
characters of action, the movement words, and the `classic` prompt's negations.
