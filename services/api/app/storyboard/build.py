"""The storyboard (storyboard.md §3.3, §4, §6 `build.py`; T026): every shot through verify's loop,
at most `concurrency` at once, each attempt and state written by T021's writer as it happens.

A shot whose renderer fails ends FAILED, logged, and the storyboard goes on (T066). Only a renderer
that looks down stops it -- no frame drawn yet and min(3, shots) frames failed: then no new shot
starts, the shots in flight are awaited (their drawings and audits are paid for, and their rows are
kept), and StoryboardError names the first failed shot in plan order. A withheld frame is
information, not a failure.
