"""The default renderer: FLUX.1 [schnell] on fal.ai (storyboard.md §3.5; T026).

One synchronous call per drawing, at most a megapixel in multiples of 16 (fal bills each started
megapixel), fitted to exactly the size asked for and post-processed in the style. Every drawing is
stored by its render key before `render` returns, so the store is the cache and the record is there
for the frame writers. A frame fal's safety checker blacks out never reaches the audit: it is drawn
again with a derived seed.
