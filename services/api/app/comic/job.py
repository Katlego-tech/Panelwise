"""The comic job (comic.md §4a; T064): render every panel at its rect through the audited loop,
letter the pages, store them by content and record the one comic of a project.

`start_comic` makes the checks and the job inside the route's transaction; `run_comic_job` runs it
in the background, like the upload's job, and always leaves the job settled. A panel the audit
already accepted for this project's comic, at its size, is reused: no render, no audit.
