"""What the model is asked for, as a strict json_schema (findings U1: enforced on Nemotron).

Names and quotes only. No age, gender or role fields: those would be the model's inference, and
an inferred attribute is an invented one. A later stage that needs to draw a character reads its
quotes. `species`, `other_names` and `sex_word` are copied words, not attributes, and the filter
grounds them (grounding.md §3, T051, T082).
