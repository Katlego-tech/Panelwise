"""Comparing a model's quote with the screenplay, and finding where it sits.

`normalize_for_grounding` is ported from FrameFlow's grounding.py. Screenplays are hard-wrapped,
so an accurate quote comes back with the wrap collapsed to a space, and a compound split across a
line break ("broad-" / "shouldered") comes back joined. Ignoring whitespace amount, case, and a
line-break hyphen does not weaken grounding: the complete word sequence must still appear, in
order. Invented or re-ordered content still fails. FrameFlow's lead character was dropped from
two runs in three by a line-break hyphen before this was fixed. Panelwise also folds curly
quotes, dashes and the ellipsis to ASCII, on both sides (PR #10 review: a prettified apostrophe
would otherwise drop an accurate quote).
