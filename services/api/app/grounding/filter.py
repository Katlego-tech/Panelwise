"""The grounding filter: only what the script says survives, each quote at a located span.

docs/design/grounding.md §4. Ported from FrameFlow's extraction_service (merge, filter) and
governance_service (faithfulness, recall), and changed where they failed:

* Filtering is per quote, not per entity. FrameFlow dropped an entity if any one quote failed,
  and lost its lead character to a single quote broken by a line-break hyphen.
* A quote must sit inside one element, so every kept quote has a span a panel can cite.
* Recall matches cues with `match_speaker` ("THABO" finds "THABO MOLEFE"); FrameFlow compared
  exact names. Speaking characters the model missed are added from the cues, but don't count
  toward the model's recall.
* Locations come from the scene headings: the parser already knows them exactly.
