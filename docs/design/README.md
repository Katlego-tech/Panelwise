# Design documents

One per non-trivial lane, named after it, so `feat/<lane>` <-> `docs/design/<lane>.md`.
Start from [DESIGN-DOC.template.md](../../DESIGN-DOC.template.md); rules and the
which-diagram-when table are in [../design-documentation.md](../design-documentation.md).

Diagrams are **Mermaid in fenced code blocks**, never images -- they diff in a PR and every
assistant can read and write them.
